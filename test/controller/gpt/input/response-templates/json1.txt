Upon re-evaluating the provided web page structure, it's clear that there is no explicitly defined row or column header.

Since no unique row or column headers are provided, we will add our own unique numbers for row headers, and there's no column header in this structure. We will represent the rowHeaderCell and columnHeaderCell with a number based on the position in the OuterTableCell.

Here's the updated JSON:

json
Copy code
{
    "UpdatedStep": "In specified wrapper table cell, click the name of the wife",
    "OuterTableCell": [
        ["col#41", "col#42"],
        ["col#44", "col#45"]
    ],
    "rowHeaderCell": "2",
    "columnHeaderCell": "2",
    "columnHeaderList": ["1", "2"],
    "rowHeaderList": ["1", "2"],
    "targetElementId": "col#45"
}
Explanation:

UpdatedStep: Remains the same as the previous interpretation.

OuterTableCell: The content cells of the table.

rowHeaderCell: The target element "Anna" is in the second row, so the row header is represented by "2".

columnHeaderCell: The target element "Anna" is in the second column, so the column header is represented by "2".

columnHeaderList: Represents columns, so we just label them 1, 2 sequentially.

rowHeaderList: Represents rows, so we just label them 1, 2 sequentially based on their position in OuterTableCell.

targetElementId: Remains the same as before; it's the ID for "Anna" which is col#45.
