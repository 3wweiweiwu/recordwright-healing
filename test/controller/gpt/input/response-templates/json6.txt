Based on the provided sections:

The "Very High" label in the severity axis from the Test Step is the div with ID #505.
The target element is part of a matrix/table structure as its parent class contains rows and the matrix structure is evident from the provided PUG template layout.
The "Very High" label serves as a header for its row, specifically a row header.
The out-most container for the target element is div#500 which is the heatmap content/body.
Thus, the output JSON would look like:
