Let's break down the [Web Page] section:

Rows (Criticality Levels):

Very High - div#505
High - div#501
Medium - div#502
Low - div#503
Very Low - div#504
Columns (Severity Levels):

Low - div#601
Medium - div#602
High - div#603
Very High - div#604
From the layout, we see that each criticality level row contains multiple cells. And each severity level (on the bottom row) corresponds to a column of cells in the table above.

Now, given that:

The criticality level "High" corresponds to row containing div#501. The severity level "Very High" corresponds to the column containing div#604.

The intersection of these references results in div#204.

Our target is the first text element within div#204, which is div#116.

Now, let's craft the JSON response:

The OuterTableCell array will be a 5x4 matrix because there are 5 rows of criticality levels and 4 columns of severity levels.

Here's the JSON:

json
Copy code
{
  "UpdatedStep": "Click on the first text element within the specified wrapper table cell.",
  "OuterTableCell": [
    ["div#200", "div#201", "div#202", "div#203"],
    ["div#204", "div#205", "div#206", "div#207"],
    ["div#208", "div#209", "div#210", "div#211"],
    ["div#212", "div#213", "div#214", "div#215"],
    ["div#216", "div#217", "div#218", "div#219"]
  ],
  "rowHeaderCell": "2",
  "columnHeaderCell": "4",
  "columnHeaderList": ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
  "rowHeaderList": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
}
Here, for the rows (Criticality levels), we have assigned numbers starting from 1 to 5. Similarly, for columns (Severity levels), we've numbered them from 1 to 4.

The intersection of row "2" (High) and column "4" (Very High) gives us the target cell.
