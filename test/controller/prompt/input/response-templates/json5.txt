To identify the target web element based on the test step, we need to interpret the test step and find the corresponding HTML structure from the provided webpage layout:

[Test Step]
"In the row name is john and age is 40 click the name of the wife"

Looking at the provided web page structure, we find the row with the name "John" and age "40" is the one with .row.bg-primary#34. In this row, the wife's name is "Anna" and it's located under the .col#45.

Given this information, here's the corresponding output in JSON format:

{
    "isTargetHeader": false,
    "targetElementId": "col#45",
    "isTargetMatrixTableGrid": true,
    "OutMostContainer": "app-sample-table#1"
}
Explanation:

"isTargetHeader": The target is not a row or column header, so it's set to false.
"targetElementId": As identified, the target element is the wife's name "Anna", which is in col#45.
"isTargetMatrixTableGrid": The target element is inside a table structure, so this value is set to true.
"OutMostContainer": The outermost table container for the target element, as described in the test step, is app-sample-table#1.
