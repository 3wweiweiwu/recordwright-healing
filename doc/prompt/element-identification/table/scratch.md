### Query

[Test Step]
In the row name is john and age is 40 click the name of the wife

[Method]

* The table within web page section provide outermost scope of a table
* Based on the outermost table, identify it has approriate column headers that summarize its context based on general visualization. In case there is sub-table or sub-matrix in the column, treat the whole sub-table and sub-matrix as one data cell in column.
* Output identification result to "isUniquecolumnHeaders"
* If there is no appropriate column header, assign a unique number to each column include in the outermost table as column header, such as 1 for first column, 2 for second column, and so on. The assignment of these number should correspond to the order of the column of outermost table
* If isUniquecolumnHeaders is false, identify the column of row header. Remove that column from the table.
* Output the column headers of outermost table to "columnHeaderList"
* Based on the test step and web page, identify the target element. Return result to targetElement.
* Iterate column header that are identified by column headers until it find target element. If target element are found within the column, The output the column header will become the output of columnHeaderCell
* Test if the target element is a column header after table header update, return result to isTargetColumnHeader.

[Output]  
Output result in JSON format.
Following is a template.
{
isUniqueColumnHeaders: boolean,
columnHeaderList:string[],
columnHeaderCell:string,
isTargetColumnHeader:boolean,
targetElement:string
}
"isUniqueColumnHeaders" represents if the table has column headers different from each other and provide genearl summaryto the content of its column.
"columnHeaderList" represents array of column header container for the out-most table. The container is in "tag#id" format. In case there is no appropriate column header, the container is in the format of number such as 1,2,3  
"columnHeaderCell" is coming from prior value of column header list. It represents the column headers that identifies the column in the out-most table containing the target element. It is within columnHeaderList. The cell container is in "tag#id" format . In case there is no column header that is generally summarize the column context, the container is in the format of number such as 1,2,3. Note that the columnHeaderCell should be the only column that contains the target element, not the target element itself.  
"isTargetColumnHeader" returns if target element is within a column header container
targetElement returns id of target element in tag#id format such as "div#100".

### Response

Based on the provided information, let's follow the method step by step:

1. The outermost scope of the table is identified by DIV#17.
2. The table does not have unique column headers that summarize its context based on general visualization. The column headers are "Name", "Age", "Email", and "Family Member", but the "Family Member" column contains a sub-table which is treated as one data cell in the column.
3. So, isUniqueColumnHeaders is false.
4. Since there are no appropriate column headers, we assign a unique number to each column in the outermost table as column header. The assignment is as follows: 1 for "Name", 2 for "Age", 3 for "Email", and 4 for "Family Member".
5. The column of row header is not identified as there is no such column.
6. The columnHeaderList is [1, 2, 3, 4].
7. The target element based on the test step is the name of the wife in the row where the name is John and age is 40. This is identified as text#144 Anna.
8. The column header that identifies the column containing the target element is 4 (Family Member).
9. The target element is not a column header.

So, the output in JSON format would be:

{
"isUniqueColumnHeaders": false,
"columnHeaderList": [1, 2, 3, 4],
"columnHeaderCell": 4,
"isTargetColumnHeader": false,
"targetElement": "text#144"
}

{
isUniqueRowHeaders: boolean,

}
"isUniqueRowHeaders" represents if the table has row headers that are different from each other and provide general summary to the content of its row.
"rowHeaderList" represents array of row header container for the out-most table. The container is in "tag#id" format. In case there is no appripriate row header, the container is in the format of number such as 1,2,3  
"rowHeaderCell" is coming from prior value of row header list. It represents the row headers that identifies the row in the out-most table containing the target element. It is within rowHeaderList. The cell container is in "tag#id" format . In case there is no row header that generally summarize the row context, the container is in the format of number such as 1,2,3. Note that the rowHeaderCell should be the only row that contains the target element, not the target element itself.  
"isTargetRowHeader" returns if target element is within a row header container
targetElement returns id of target element in tag#id format such as "div#100".

### response

Based on the web page layout, the table does not have unique row headers that summarize its context. Therefore, isUniqueRowHeaders is false. We will assign a unique number to each row in the outermost table as a row header.

The row headers of the outermost table are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

The target element based on the test step is the name of the wife in the row where the name is John and the age is 40. This is text#144 Anna.

Iterating through the row headers, we find that the target element is in the row with the header 3.

The target element is not a row header.

Therefore, the output is:

{
"isUniqueRowHeaders": false,
"rowHeaderList": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8"],
"rowHeaderCell": "3",
"isTargetRowHeader": false,
"targetElement": "text#144"
}
