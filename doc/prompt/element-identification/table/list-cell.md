1. The web page section provide outermost scope of a table.
2. Based on the outermost table, get the context of each row. Analyze if it has correct row headers that summarize its context and served as label for data.
3. If there is no correct row header in each row, add row header to original table with unique number such as 1,2,3.
4. Based on the outermost table, get the context of each column. Analyze if it has correct column headers that summarize its context and served as label for data.
5. If there is no correct column header in each column, add column header to original table with unique number such as 1,2,3.
6. Iterate through each row of outermost table. In each row, iterate through each column header and save the column container of each row into array. The column container should corresponds to a column header. If a column header has multiple cells corresponds to it, only output outermost container. Do not include row or column header in the array.
7. After completing row iteration, combine all the array together and output that into OuterTableCell

[Output]
Output result in JSON format. Following is a template. Output JSON only. No reasoning.  
{
OuterTableCell:string[][],  
}  

"OuterTableCell" represents outer-most table in array of array format. The outer array represents array of rows. The inner array represents array data cell container in the row. The data cell container follows "tag#id" strictly. For example: div#5.
