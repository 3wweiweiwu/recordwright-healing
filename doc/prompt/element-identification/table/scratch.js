Based on the provided information, let's follow the method step by step:

1. The outermost scope of the table is identified by DIV#17.
2. The table does not have unique column headers that summarize its context based on general visualization. The column headers are "Name", "Age", "Email", and "Family Member", but the "Family Member" column contains a sub-table which is treated as one data cell in the column.
3. So, isUniqueColumnHeaders is false.
4. Since there are no appropriate column headers, we assign a unique number to each column in the outermost table as column header. The assignment is as follows: 1 for "Name", 2 for "Age", 3 for "Email", and 4 for "Family Member".
5. The column of row header is not identified as there is no such column.
6. The columnHeaderList is [1, 2, 3, 4].
7. The target element based on the test step is the name of the wife in the row where the name is John and age is 40. This is identified as text#144 Anna.
8. The column header that identifies the column containing the target element is 4 (Family Member).
9. The target element is not a column header.

So, the output in JSON format would be:

{
"isUniqueColumnHeaders": false,
"columnHeaderList": [1, 2, 3, 4],
"columnHeaderCell": 4,
"isTargetColumnHeader": false,
"targetElement": "text#144"
}
