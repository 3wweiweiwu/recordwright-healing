[Test Step]  
Click on the first text element within
[Method]

1. Based on the test step and web page, identify the target element. Return result to targetElement
2. Traverse through all parent container of target element all the way to the top level container, get the outermost table or matrix container for the target element. If outermost table or matrix exists, output the result of outermost table or matrix identification result to OutMostContainer.
3. If outermost table or matrix exists according to prior step, classify the if outermost table or matrix container is a table or matrix based definition. Output that to the OutermostContainerType. 
   * Definition of table: A table typically contains structured, tabular data where each row represents a different record and each column represents a different field or attribute. For example, a row might represent an individual person, and columns might represent details about that person, like their name and relationship status. 
   * Definition of matrix: A matrix, on the other hand, often refers to a two-dimensional array or a cross-tabulation of data. It's typically used when data is more complex and relationships between different data points are being represented. For example, a matrix might show the correlations between different variables.

[Output]
Output result in JSON format.
{
"targetElementId":"",
"OutMostContainer"string,
"OutermostContainerType":string
}
targetElementId returns id of target element in tag#id format such as "div#100".
OutMostContainer is the outermost container for the target element. If it exists, it's in "tag#id" foramt such as "div#100". If it does not exists, it is null.
OutermostContainerType returns type of Outer most container. It's will return one of following: "matrix", "table" or null.
