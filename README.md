# Daniel ideas

- Add documentation like UCs or descriptions, that will be helpful in the future
- Add next steps or ideas
- Add UC diagrams
- Integrate ChateGPT query in this repo
- Set Express framework (It use to include extra files and functionalities)
- In the future will be good to automate the creation of the JSON file needed in the UT
